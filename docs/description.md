# Overview

This block is designed for analyzing Single-chain Fragment Variable (scFv) sequencing data. Its core purpose is to take raw sequencing reads from scFv libraries and perform a detailed alignment. This process identifies and separates the three key functional elements of each scFv molecule: the **variable heavy (VH)** chain, the **variable light (VL)** chain, and the synthetic **linker** peptide sequence connecting them.

Due to the wide variety of scFv library designs, this block is highly configurable. Correctly setting the parameters to match your specific experimental setup is crucial for achieving accurate and meaningful results.
